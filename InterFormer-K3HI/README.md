**This is the code for InterFormer on the K3HI dataset.**

**WARNING : the code was tested on Windows, it should work on Macos and Linux but in case of trouble running it we recommend to use Windows**

To test our model on the K3HI dataset use in a terminal:
```
	python test.py -load_weights Model -batch_size 2
	to generate the reactions without visuals
	
	python test.py -load_weights Model -batch_size 2 -visual
	to generate the reactions with visuals. Takes longer.
```

**IMPORTANT: the batch size of 2 works for a GPU with 8Go of video memory. Adapt the batch size according to your own GPU.**
	
After generating the reactions :
```
	python classifier.py
	to get the classification accuracy and get the deep features.
	
	python compute_FVD.py
	to get the FVD and diversity score. classifier.py must be used before to get the deep features
```	
	
Visuals are stored in the folders :
	- "visual" for comparison with the ground truth (left GT, right generated. In blue the action, in the other color the reaction)
	- "visual_single" for only the motion generated with InterFormer (in blue the action, in red the reaction)
	


Parts of the Interformer code are based on the code from  : https://github.com/SamLynnEvans/Transformer
The DeepGRU classifier code is based on : https://github.com/Maghoumi/DeepGRU
